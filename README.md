# Project System Tools
This repo contains a set of tools to make working with the Visual Studio project system for C#, Visual Basic, and F# easier. You can find the Visual Studio extension it produces [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioProductTeam.ProjectSystemTools). Current features include:

## Build logging
A tool window is added under ```View > Other Windows > Build Logging```. The window allows logging both regular and design-time builds in the project system.
